            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>A mission clearly tells what you as an organization does for customers. A mission is comprehensive but
                also very specific to set you apart from other organizations.</p>

            <h3>Vission</h3>
            <p>There are many parts of your eye and brain that come together to allow you to see. This makes up your
                vision. The lens, retina and optic nerve are several important parts of your eye that allow you to
                transform light and electrical signals into images.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>A general aim toward which to strive; a statement of a desired future state, condition, or purpose.
                A goal differs from an objective by having a broader deadline, and usually by being long range rather
                than short range.</p>

            <p>Becket was murdered in the north transept of the cathedral on 29 December 1170. Four years later a
                disastrous
                fire destroyed the eastern end of the church. After William of Sens had rebuilt the Choir, William the
                Englishman added the immense Corona as a shrine for the crown of St. Thomas (with a new shrine for the
                main
                relics in the form of the Trinity Chapel between the Corona and the Choir)
